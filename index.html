									<div class="inner"><h3>Tactics</h3>
										<p>For one, stealth rocks is something that you don't use in game, but is almost an essential in competetive play because as people switch out their Pokemon, stealth rocks damage is there. They can do a signifficant amount of damage. Also moves that boost up your stats are also used more often because as when someone switches out you have the opportunity to boost your stats if you made your predictions correctly. Moves that allow you to switch out are also very nice as when you think that someone is going to switch out to a Pokemon that counters you, you can then use switching out moves like U-turn to turn the tide in your favour.</p>

										<h3>Differences between in game Pokemon and competetive play.</h3>
										<p>The main difference between in game and competetive is that who you play against are humans. In game you get to have the option to switch when the computer is chooses to place their Pokemon. This would usually allow you to counter them whilst their Pokemon is switching in. In competetive none of that exists. Also humans generally have better Pokemon teams more balanced teams. Also when people are in a bad matchup they tend to switch out, rather than om game they don't bother.</p>

									<div class="inner">
										<h3>Team building</h3>
										<p></p> There are 3 typical play styles when playing Pokemon. Hyper offensive, offensive and stall teams. Hyper offense is when the Pokemon they use all have a lot of damage. However this typically leaves these Pokemon very vulnerable. Stall is the complete opposite. Their teams are based on tanky Pokemon and trying to stall opposing teams to death. Offense is a mix of the two.

									<div class="inner">
										<h3>IV's</h3>
										<p>Sometimes you feel that you need some Pokemon of the same species, this is mainly because of natures. IV's and EV's. Natures boost a stat and lower another stat. Lets say that you don't need speed, but you want more attack then a nature allows you to do so. iV's are also very important, they range from 0-31 and the higher the better because you get a whole stat for IV. Lets say you have a two Pokemon of the same species, one of them has 0IV's in every stat and the other has 31 IV's in all stats. The one with 31 IV's would be far more superior because it's got more of everything. It can do more.  </p>
